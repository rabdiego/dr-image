# DR Image
Full Machine Learning model development life cycle, from data management, to model management and model deployment.

## Context
This project is aimed to serve as a portifolio for my career as a Machine Learning Engineer. Here I apply my knowledge of ML model development in a nature-themed application capable of recognizing 5 different flower species.

## The dataset
The data will be stored locally, as it contains more than 4K images of different flowers. You can download it from its [Kaggle repository]([www.google.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)).
